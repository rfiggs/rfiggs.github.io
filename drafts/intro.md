Over the summer I was working on developing a web application for the ITS department of UH. Before starting the job I did not know much about web design, and this project has given me the chance to learn a lot of new technologies. The project that we did this summer was a small project with just me and one other student working on it. We were given instructions to create an In/Out board that would make it easy to check to see who is out of the office.

Since there were only two of us, we both got to experience the full process of developing a web app. We each worked on parts of the backend and parts of the front end. While The project over the summer was a great experience, in the workforce it is unlikely that I will be working with only one other person on a project. I look forward to learning how to be a more productive member or a larger team.

I am also interested in learning more about user interfaces. For the project at work we were given a functional specification that defined what the UI should look like. This gave us some structure to work with and ensured that the app looked clean. It would be interesting, however, to know the reasoning behind various design choices.

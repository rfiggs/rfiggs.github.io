Club connector was a project that three other students and I developed for our software engineering class. Club connector is a place where University of Hawaii can go to quickly find Clubs based on their interests. The main page of the site is a browse clubs page where students can search for clubs based on that club's tags. Club's can contact the admin of Club connector to register someone as that club's profile administrator. That person can add new tags, remove tags and update the clubs image and description.

This project was an excellent exercise in team work and communication. Getting physically together to work on the project was hard for our team because our schedules did not line up. We could really only meet for an hour every week or so. Becuase of this we had to rely mainy on online solutions. We used slack to communicate and help each other out. We used Github's issues and projects systems to organize or tasks.

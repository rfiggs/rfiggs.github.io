This project began with a Christmas present I receive from my parents last year. The gift was a Raspberry Pi 2, which is basically just a small simple computer. I decided that I would use it to set up a Minecraft server for me and my friends. This worked for a few weeks, but the Raspberry Pi wasn't strong enough to keep up with the demands of a Minecraft server. I decided that we needed an upgrade and took the opportunity to set up my own Linux server.

I used a old dell laptop to run the server on. I'd forgotten the password to this laptop years ago, so I had no issues with wiping out all the contents and installing a new operating system on it. I downloaded the USB bootable version of Ubuntu on to one of my flash drives, and found an installation guide online. It took a few tries to correctly install the opperating system, but I finally got it running. After Ubuntu was installed I downloaded the latest version of java, and the Minecraft server jar, and loaded our Minecraft world onto the new machine. From this experience I learned some new things about how computers work, and I got plenty of practice with the linux command line.

SemanticUI is a tool designed to help web developers make clean webpages.
SemanticUI differs from similar software in that it aims to be as plain language as possible.
For example in twitter bootstrap to make a large red button you would need to use the following classes.
"btn btn-large btn-danger"
Whereas in SemanticUI it is "ui large red button".
This "plain english" feel of SemanticUI make its easier to learn than other frameworks.

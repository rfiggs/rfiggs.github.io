Css was introduced to solve a stylizing problem in html.
Css is very powerful but can get complicated to use correctly.
you may have noticed that a lot of websites these days have a similar layout.
this is thanks to tools like semantic ui 

SemanticUI is a tool designed to help web developers make clean webpages.
SemanticUI differs from similar software in that it aims to be as plain language as possible.
For example in twitter bootstrap to make a large red button you would need to use the following classes.
"btn btn-large btn-danger"
Whereas in SemanticUI it is "ui large red button".
This "plain english" feel of SemanticUI make its easier to learn than other frameworks.

Explain how to use semantic ui
Classes in semantic ui are broken up into 4 fields.
The group is called elements.
These are the most basic type of thing there is.
Things like buttons, dividers, and images.
Elements generally only serve one purpose.
The next group is called collections.
Collections are various schemas used to organize multiple elements on the screen.
You can use collections to make a menu bar for your site.
or you can use the form collection.
forms are groupings of various inputs that you recive from the user.
views are commonly grouped together elements that are used heavily.
an example of one of these is the ui card view.
The card view looks like a card witha picture at tht top and a description below it, all contained within a rounded corner rectangle.

explain benefits of SemanticUI
By using semantic you can be sure that your things will be uniform
modifiers in semantic are more or less universal.
This means you can say something like "large icon" or "Large Button".
While these two things will end up different sizes, they will be "large" relative to other elements of the same type.
Using semantic makes it easy to make your website mobile compatable, becaues it does most of that for you already.

Prior to JavaScript the only programming language I knew was java. I have been programming in java since high school, so JavaScript was a new experience for me. I first encountered JavaScript this past summer while developing a web app for the Information and Technology Center of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Web apps are a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript is used in web apps mainly to manipulate elements on the html page. During my Software Engineering course, we were required to complete the JavaScript exercises at freecodingcamp.com. The exercises at freecodingcamp.com are thorough and cover all of the basics of JavaScript. I wish I had discovered these at the beginning of the summer, because I learned some useful tricks form the exercises. For example, I didn’t know that you could remove properties from objects in JavaScript, because in Java once you declare an object’s properties, you can change the values of the properties, but you can’t add new properties or remove unwanted ones. While JavaScript’s syntax is similar to Java’s syntax, there are a lot of features that make JavaScript more versatile. In Java if you want a specific character from a string, you have to use a function of some sort. In JavaScript you can simply treat the string as a character array and access the characters directly without an extra function. 
JavaScript is designed to help programmers be more efficient with their time. When programming in Java, every time you declare a variable you must also declare its type. In JavaScript however, you do not need to declare a type, it will figure out on its own what type of variable it needs to be. JavaScript even makes object oriented programming a little easier. In Java when you define an object it has to be in its own file, and then you have to instantiate an instance, and assign it the proper values. In JavaScript this is all you have to do.

```
var obj = {
	someProperty : someValue
}
```

Instead of having a whole file for an object definition, JavaScript can do it in a few lines of code right where you need it. JavaScript also surprised me with the fact that with it, you can return a function from a function. In Java this does not work at all, in fact I didn’t even know it was a possibility. JavaScript has turned out to be a versatile language, that enables quick programming.

The concept of athletic software engineering is something that I hand not heard of before, but after learning about it, I am excited to continue. The core of this concept are WODs, or work outs of the day, which Professor Johnson has adapted form cross fit. In a software engineering context, these WODs manifest as programming challenges that you must complete within a certain time limit. Instead of muscles, these WODs are designed to train your problem solving skills. These challenges are demanding, and require quick thinking. This is where a language JavaScript excels, with JavaScript you don’t have to worry about the little things like variable types, or large object definitions. Using JavaScript, the programmer can focus more on solving the problem, and less on the small details, which ultimately leads to a better understanding.

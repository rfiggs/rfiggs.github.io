When working on a large team of software developers, a number of problems arise. The biggest one being the management of the source code. The source code can be many files, distributed amongst all of the programmers involved. This can become chaotic quickly. What happens when one programmer changes code in one of the files? That programmer then needs to send the updated code to every other programmer. What happens if one programmer didn't get the email with the new code? Bugs will arise in the program down the line, and it can take some time for them to realize that they are missing a file. Programs like subversion and Git, are designed to bring structure, and organization to this complicated process.

Git aims to fix the above issue by keeping the code in something called a repository. If a programmer wants to work on a piece of code, they can get it from the repository. When they make a change they can push the change to the repository. By keeping the source code in a centralized place that all the coders have access to, you lessen the risk of someone not having the correct version of code. Git also has another feature that is important for software development, a history of changes. Git keeps track of every change made to the code, as well as who made the change. This is especially useful when you are trying to debug a program. You can look through the Git log to figure out when the bug was introduced, and who introduced it. Git is not the only piece of software like this, in fact it's not even the first. Git is relatively new, and has grown in popularity thanks to GitHub.

Github allows users to store their Git repositories on Github's cloud for free. The catch, is that these free repositories are public repositories which are available for anyone to view. This service appeals to college students, who are usually on a budget, and don't mind if their class projects are publicly available. Group coding projects can be stressful, but Github helps make the process a little bit easier. Students use Github to share their code, and use Git to keep track of all of the changes. This, among other factors, is why Git is one of the most popular program for configuration management.

Configuration management has become essential in any large coding project. It helps to give structure to the coding process, and keeps track of everything that happens. Since Github is widely used by college students, many companies have started to use Github to save on training time and cost. Github, and configuration management in general, has become a vital part of being a software developer.

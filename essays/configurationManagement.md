{Explain popularity}

{Talk about why i should use github}

When working on a large team of software developers, a number of problems arise. The biggest issue is managing the source code for the project. One solution is to make a copy of the code for each programmer, however this solution can get complicated quickly. What happens when one programmer changes code in one of the files? That programmer then needs to send the file to every other programmer so that everyone has up to date code. What happens if one programmer didn't get the email with your new code? Bugs would arise in the program down the line and it could take a while for the programmer to realize that they are missing a file. Programs like subversion and git try to bring some structure to this chaos.

 **talk about git here**

Git is a piece of software designed to help teams of software developers keep track of various changes in their code. Git keeps track of changes using a system of commits. Git is used to manage different versions of software.

Configuration management is essential to any software developer. In short, programs like subversion and git, can be used to manage different versions of the code. Since source code is almost always changing, and could be used by many programmers, it is important to keep track of all of the changes made to the code. This way if the code breaks, one could look back in the history and find the cause of the fault.

Git would not be as popular as it is today without Github. Github allows users to store their repositories on Github's cloud for free. The catch is that these free repositories are public repositories and anyone can see them. Github does offer private repositories for a monthly fee. Github's popularity stems from the free repositories, it lets you back up your code to the cloud for free. This is perfect for college students who are just learning how to program. When first learning how to code, you don't really need to protect the code that you are writing, so the fact that your Github repository is public is of little consequence. In fact having your code in a public repository could be helpful. Since anyone can see the code that you have written, if you need help with something you can ask the other person to pull the code up on Github, instead of having to deal with bulky file transfers, or meeting in person.
